## Notes:

The majority of my time was dedicated to experimenting with Tailwind CSS. Consequently, I embarked on crafting a rudimentary design aimed at facilitating navigation across various pages. Employing React Router DOM, I seamlessly integrated page navigation functionalities. Concurrently, I initiated the development of my API and seamlessly linked MongoDB to serve as the backbone of my project's database.

## Open-source libraries used:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) - A lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the React JavaScript library
- [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - An open-source utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by offering a comprehensive set of pre-designed utility classes.
- [Flowbite](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite) -  an open-source CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and easily.
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) - An open-source build tool for modern web development, offering a fast development server and rapid build times.
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) - An open-source library for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env in Node.js applications.
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - An open-source library for MongoDB and Node.js, offering a schema-based solution to simplify data modeling and interaction with MongoDB databases.

## Notes:

In part 2, I integrated several tools: Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, and React Redux, to manage and persist backend data, enabling seamless user sign-in retention. Leveraging Firebase for OAuth login, I extracted and presented user information in a dropdown menu. Next, I'll develop a dashboard allowing users to modify their email, username, and password.
